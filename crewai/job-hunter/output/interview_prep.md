- **Async Patterns:** Implemented async/await HTTP clients; prototyped federated-learning pipelines with asynchronous requests.
- **Full-Stack Delivery:** Developed React-based dashboards and React Native mobile features; integrated via GraphQL and REST.
- **DevOps & Cloud:** Dockerized microservices, managed deployments (AWS ECS Fargate, Lambda, RDS), built CI/CD pipelines (GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).
- **Collaboration:** Led async design docs, PRs, API contracts; conducted cross-timezone code reviews.
- **Key Projects:**  
  - Federated Learning API (FastAPI, async HTTP, secure aggregation)  
  - Real-Time Anomaly Dashboard (Flask + WebSockets + React)  
  - Cross-Platform Content App (React Native + GraphQL subscriptions)

   - Tools you use to stay aligned without synchronous meetings.  
6. **Full-Stack Integration**  
   - Handling CORS, authentication (OAuth2/JWT), and real-time updates (WebSockets).  
   - Debugging cross-platform issues between Python backends and React Native frontends.  

## Questions to Ask Them
- Team & Culture  
  - “How does Aperus onboard new engineers into the async-first process?”  
  - “Can you share a standout async collaboration that accelerated delivery?”  
- Tech & Architecture  
  - “What drove the decision to build Aperus Sync rather than adopt existing tools?”  
  - “How do you manage API versioning and database migrations across microservices?”  
- Delivery & Quality  
  - “How are code-review SLAs and quality metrics tracked in an async model?”  
  - “What’s the incident response workflow and on-call handoff process?”  
- Career Growth  
  - “What distinguishes IC2 from IC3 in terms of scope and impact?”  
  - “How does Aperus support ongoing learning and conference participation?”  
- Roadmap & Vision  
  - “Which new product areas or verticals is Aperus targeting next?”  
  - “How do you balance client project work with open-source/internal tool investments?”  

## Concepts To Know/Review
- FastAPI: dependency injection, middleware, background tasks, performance tuning  
- Python asyncio: event loop, tasks, concurrency vs. parallelism  
- REST vs. GraphQL API design; WebSockets for real-time updates  
- Microservices patterns: idempotency, circuit breakers, observability (OpenTelemetry)  
- Docker best practices; deployment on AWS ECS Fargate and Lambda  
- CI/CD pipelines: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, blue/green or canary deployments  
- Async collaboration tools: Notion, Slack, Linear, GitHub Projects, Loom  

## Strategic Advice
- **Tone:** Confident, concise, and async-savvy. Show you’re comfortable making decisions independently.  
- **Focus Areas:** Emphasize ownership—how you drove feature delivery end-to-end in async teams. Highlight your remote communication playbook.  
- **Storytelling:** Use the STAR format for technical challenges (e.g., optimizing async data pipelines).  
- **Red Flags:**  
  - Avoid complaining about timezone differences—frame them as opportunities.  
  - Don’t over-emphasize synchronous meetings; demonstrate your async communication strengths.  
- **Closing:** Reiterate your excitement for Aperus’s async culture and how you’ll contribute to scaling their Python microservices.  
- **Follow-Up:** Send a concise, well-structured thank-you note that continues the async-first style—include a Loom video recap or link to a relevant GitHub snippet.
